### INTRODUCTION
Mara Energy is an oil and gas firm situated in Lagos that caters for the need of select companies and agencies who have subscribed to their service.  Mara energy delivers fuel with tankers to customers in Lagos from one source. 
Mara is hoping to expand by outsourcing most of its services in order to meet with the ever growing demand of fuel in the metropolis but still maintaining the market share.
A fuel on demand app is thereby suggested as this will go a long way in catering for the needs of its ever growing client base.

### THE PROBLEM 
The Power companies in Nigeria are constantly struggling with either power generation or distribution and this poses a big problem to any business that depends majorly on power for production. Over the years businesses have depended on Power generators of different capacity in order to run their business. The bigger problem is getting the fuel onsite when itâ€™s needed and at a convenient rate by a supplier at a good rate because most of these companies are located in industrial estates that are away from service stations.
At an extra cost businesses are forced to have their own pay extra for logistics or dedicate a vehicle for this purpose.
Even private individuals who run out of fuel while on a trip around the city or at home at odd hours after service stations might have closed may seem impossible or stressful as service stations that opened late at night are usually located around the city centers which may be very far from your location. 
Fleet management also comes with a huge burden as some unscrupulous drivers may take advantage of this to enrich themselves while reducing the quantity per fill up. 

### THE SOLUTION 
In order to solve most of the problems above we came up with FUELL.
